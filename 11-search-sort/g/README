Exercise 1
----------

Create a file search.c with the following function.

    int bsearch(int *arr, int size, int val);

The function should do a BINARY SEARCH on 'arr' for the number 'val'. 
'size' is the total number of elements in the array 'arr'. The function should 
return 1 on success, 0 otherwise.

You can test using 'make test_bsearch'.


Exercise 2
----------

Create a file sort.c with the following function.

    void sort(int *arr, int size);

The function should do a SELECTION SORT of array 'arr'. 'size' is the total
number of elements in the array. Note that the sorted sequence is also stored
in the same array 'arr'.

You can test using 'make test_sort'.


Exercise 3
----------

Create a file qsort.c with the following function.

    void qsort(int *arr, int size);

The function should do a QUICK SORT of array 'arr'. 'size' is the total
number of elements in the array. Note that the sorted sequence is also stored
in the same array 'arr'.

You can test using 'make test_qsort'.
