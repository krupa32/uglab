Exercise 1
----------

Create a file search.c with the following function.

    int bsearch(int *arr, int size, int val);

The function should do a BINARY SEARCH on 'arr' for the number 'val'. 
'size' is the total number of elements in the array 'arr'. The function should 
return 1 on success, 0 otherwise.


Exercise 2
----------

Create a file sort.c with the following function.

    void sort(int *arr, int size);

The function should do an INSERTION SORT of array 'arr'. 'size' is the total
number of elements in the array. Note that the sorted sequence is also stored
in the same array 'arr'.


Exercise 3
----------

Create a file qsort.c with the following function.

    void mergesort(int *arr, int size);

The function should do a MERGE SORT of array 'arr'. 'size' is the total
number of elements in the array. Note that the sorted sequence is also stored
in the same array 'arr'.
