GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------

This session introduces you to Makefiles and how make is used. For more
details on how 'make' works, you can refer to 01-intro/make.txt.

This session contains 4 exercises for you to solve - ex1, ex2, ex3 and ex4.
Each exercise requires you to create a corresponding C file, ie, ex1.c,
ex2.c, ex3.c and ex4.c. After solving exercise 1, you can type

    $ make ex1

to compile and build the 'ex1' executable. This will allow you to fix any 
compilation errors. Once the 'ex1' executable is built, you can test your
solution by typing

    $ make test_ex1

Similarly, for building and testing ex2, you can type 'make ex2' and
'make test_ex2'. And for ex3, you can type 'make ex3' and 'make test_ex3'.

Hint: You can define a temporary buffer in your function and use strcpy
library function wherever required.


Exercise 1
----------

Create a file ex1.c with the following C function.

    int maxx(int a, int b, int c);

The function should return the maximum of the 3 numbers.

Examples:
    Input: a=1, b=3, c=2
    Output: 3

    Input: a = -1, b = -3, c=2
    Output: 2


Exercise 2
----------

Create a file ex2.c which has the following C function.

    void rotate(char *str, int direction, int count);

This function should rotate the characters in the string 'str' by 'count'
number of characters. If direction is 1, left rotation is done. If direction
is 2, right rotation is done. The resulting rotated string is stored in the same
string 'str'.

Example:
    Input: str = "12345678", direction = 1, count = 3
    Output: str = "45678123"

    Input: str = "12345678", direction = 2, count = 3
    Output: str = "67812345"


Exercise 3
----------

Create a file ex3.c with the following C function.

    void num_to_words(int n, char *words);

The function should convert the given number 'n' into words, and store it in
the 'words' argument. You can assume 'n' lies between 1 and 99999.

For eg,
    Input: n = 100
    Output: words = "One Hundred"

    Input: n = 127
    Output: words = "One Hundred Twenty Seven"

    Input: n = 22345
    Output: words = "Twenty Two Thousand Three Hundred Forty Five"

    Input: n = 22045
    Output: words = "Twenty Two Thousand Forty Five"

    Input: n = 22305
    Output: words = "Twenty Two Thousand Three Hundred Five"


Exercise 4
----------

Create a file ex4.c with the following C function.

    void get_word(char *str, int n, char *word);

This function takes a string 'str' and a number 'n' as parameter. It should
return the n'th word in the string 'str'. The return value should be copied
to the 'word' parameter. If n is greater than number of words in the string,
then the function should copy a null string "" to 'word'. You can assume each
word is separated by a blank space ' '.

Examples:
    Input: str = "Hello World", n = 2
    Output: word = "World"

    Input: str = "Hello World", n = 3
    Output: word = ""
