   This repository consists of problem statements along with their test stubs 
for each exercise listed in the syllabus of BE CSE semester 3 data structures 
lab (CS8311).

Directory Structure
-------------------
Each exercise has a directory exN, and each programming problem for that
exercise has a directory exN/pX. For each student, the files in one of the 
problem directory will be copied to the student's workarea/home.
