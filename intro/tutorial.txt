This is a step-by-step tutorial on how to create, compile, and run basic
C programs in the linux environment. Detailed information regarding the tools
used can be seen in the accompanying linux.txt, vim.txt, gcc.txt and make.txt
files.

STEP 1 - ACCESSING LINUX
------------------------

Linux can be accessed using a standalone desktop model with Linux installed on
it, or using a client-server model where users/clients can use a communication
program like telnet/ssh from any desktop (client) running any OS and login to 
a single Linux server machine. We will be using the client-server model, 
because this model offers lot of flexibility and convenience.

You can connect to a Linux server using a telnet program. Open the windows
command prompt and type

    c:\> telnet 10.1.1.80

This will connect to a Linux server machine on IP address 10.1.1.80 and
display a login screen. You can use the login name and password given to you
by the lab administrator.

STEP 2 - CREATING A C PROGRAM
-----------------------------

Vim is an editor that can be used to create any text file, including C
programs. Vim is a very powerful editor, but it takes a little while to get
used to it.

Type

    $ vim hello.c

to start the vim editor. Press 'i' to enter into INSERT mode. Now type the
following C program. [Note: Pressing ESC key reverts vim back into command
mode. To enter into INSERT mode again, press 'i' key].

    #include <stdio.h>

    int main()
    {
        printf("Hello World!\n");
        return 0;
    }

After you have typed the above legendary hello world program, press ESC to
go back to vim command mode. Now type

    :wq

to save/write (w) the file, and quit (q). This will take you back to the shell
prompt.

STEP 3 - COMPILING THE PROGRAM
------------------------------

Linux include the 'gcc' C compiler by default. Type

    $ gcc hello.c

to compile the hello.c. This will create an executable file called a.out in the
same directory. [Note: You can use 'ls' command to list the files in the
current directory and verify that a.out is indeed present].

STEP 4 - RUNNING THE EXECUTABLE
-------------------------------

Type

    $ ./a.out

to run the executable and verify 'Hello World!' is printed on screen.

STEP 5 - CREATE MORE PROGRAMS
-----------------------------

Now that you know how to create a simple C program, compile it and run it,
repeat steps 1 to 4 to create more C programs and become familiar with the
environment. You might encounter interesting questions and behavior on the 
way. Welcome to Linux. Happy journey!
