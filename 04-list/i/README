GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------

The following exercises will require you to declare a structure and implement
some functions using that structure.

All structure declarations MUST be done in a .h header file.
All function implementation MUST be done in a .c file, which #include's the
corresponding .h header file.


Exercise 1
----------

Create a file point.h with the following structure declaration.

    struct point
    {
        int x;
        int y;
    };

Create a file point.c which #includes the "point.h" file.
Implement the following C function in point.c.

    void move(struct point *p, int offx, int offy);

The function should move the x, y, in point 'p' by offset 'offx' and 'offy'
respectively.

You can test by using 'make test_point'.

Examples:
    Input: p = { 0, 0 }, offx = 10, offy = 15
    Output: p = { 10, 15 }

    Input: p = { 10, 15 }, offx = -15, offy = 20
    Output: p = { -5, 35 }


Exercise 2
----------

Create a file record.h with the following structure.

    #define MAX_NAME	25

    struct record
    {
        int roll_num;
        char name[MAX_NAME];
        int mark;

        struct record *next;
    }

Create a file record.c that implements the following C functions.

    struct record *rec_alloc(int roll_num, const char *name, int mark);

    void rec_free(struct record *p);

    void rec_add(struct record *head, struct record *p);

    struct record *rec_find(struct record *head, int roll_num);

    void rec_remove(struct record *head, struct record *p);

The 'rec_alloc' function should allocate a new record, fill the members 
with given values and return the pointer to the record. If memory is not
available, it may return NULL.

The 'rec_free' function should free memory allocated for the record.

The 'rec_add' function should add a record 'p' to the tail of the linked 
list pointed by 'head'.

The 'rec_find' should search for a record with 'roll_num' in the linked list
with given 'head'. It should return the pointer to the record, or NULL if
a record with given roll_num is not found.

The 'rec_remove' function should remove the record 'p' from the linked list
pointed by 'head'. Note that rec_remove MUST NOT free the record. It should
ONLY remove/unlink the record from the list.

You can test by using 'make test_record'.


Exercise 3
----------

*** YOU HAVE TO FINISH EXERCISE 2 BEFORE PROCEEDING ***

Create a file record_sorted.c, with the following function.

    void rec_add_sorted(struct record *head, struct record *p);

    void rec_reverse(struct record **head);

The 'rec_add_sorted' function should add the record 'p' such that the list 
always contains records in ascending order of roll number. That is, the list
always contains records sorted on roll number.

The 'rec_reverse' function should reverse the list in place (that is, no 
new record should be allocated), and store the head of the reversed list
back in the 'head' pointer. Note that 'head' is a double pointer, so that
the reversed list head can be stored back.

In case you are not able to reverse the list in place, you can try creating
a new list in reverse order and return the head of this new reversed list.
But this may be more difficult than reversing in place.



Exercise 4
----------

*** YOU HAVE TO FINISH EXERCISE 2 BEFORE PROCEEDING ***

There are two major drawbacks in using the above linked list implementation.

1) 'malloc' takes time every time it is called
2) 'malloc' may fail if there is no free memory

To avoid these two problems, applications tend to follow the 'cache' design.

A record cache is an array of struct record's. It is preallocated when an
application initializes, and remains in memory as long as the application runs.

After allocating a record cache, it has to be initialized. Initialization
involves linking all the struct record elements of the array. Typically,
every record element's next will point to the next element in the array.

The record cache looks as follows.

       arr[0]        arr[1]       arr[2]       arr[3]
    -----------------------------------------------------
    | ... | next | ... | next | ... | next | ... | next |
    -----------------------------------------------------
     ^       |    ^        |   ^        |   ^       |
     |       |____|        |___|        |___|       --> NULL
     |
  cache 

Allocating a record involves removing the head of the cache and returning it.

Freeing a record involves adding the record to the head of the cache.

Rest of the linked list functions (add, find, remove) work seamlessly without
any modifications (from record.c).

Create a file record_cache.c with the following C functions.

    struct record *rec_cache_init(int num_records);

    struct record *rec_alloc_from_cache(struct record **cache,
			int roll_num, const char *name, int mark);

    void rec_free_to_cache(struct record **cache, struct record *p);

The 'rec_cache_init' function should allocate an array of struct records, of
size 'num_records'. After that, it should initialize the array elements into
a linked list. It should return the pointer to the first array element, which
will be used as the cache head. If no memory available, it may return NULL.

The 'rec_alloc_from_cache' removes the head of the given cache, and updates
the cache to point to the next element. It fills in the given information,
and returns the allocated element. It returns NULL if there are no records
in the cache. Note that 'cache' is a double pointer.

The 'rec_free_to_cache' adds the record 'p' to the head of the cache and
updates cache to point to this new head. Note that 'cache' is a double pointer.

You can test using 'make test_rec_cache'.
