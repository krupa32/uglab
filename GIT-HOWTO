This small tutorial is to help you get upto speed on git.

WHAT IS GIT?
------------
Git is a version control system, similar to CVS, Perforce, Clearcase etc.

HOW GIT WORKS
-------------

In a normal version control system like cvs, perforce etc, a single
repository of the source code is maintained in a shared server machine.
Users can 'checkout' code from this server, and 'checkin' their changes
back to this server. This model is intuitive and easily understandable.

Git uses a less intuitive model, which offers more flexibility for developers.
The philosophy of git is that every user maintains his/her own repository
in their local machine, to which they can checkin changes. Any user can then
'pull' changes from other users' repositories whenever desired, merge the
changes, and checkin to their local repository.

When you pull from other user's repository, the other user's repository
is also called as a 'remote'.

GIT WORKFLOWS
-------------

Based on how git works, ie, each user maintains their own repository,
there are two different workflow models.

A) Pull Model
	This is the model explained above and is the intended way git is 
to be used. Each user maintains a local repository, and whenever they need
another user's (remote's) changes, they pull in the changes and merges them.

B) Shared Repository Model
	This is the model how cvs, perforce works. There is a single shared
repository. Every user checks out from this repository, makes changes, and
checks in the changes. It is not the intended way to use git, so git must 
be used to 'simulate' this model. The following diagram explains how this model
can be simulated using git.

                           Single Shared Repository
                             |             |
           -------------------             ----------
           |                                         |
    Local Mirror of   | Copy of                Local Mirror of   | Copy of
    Shared Repository | Local Mirror           Shared Repository | Local Mirror

Each user maintains a local mirror of the single shared repository. This local
mirror is always up-to-date and exact mirror of the shared repository. The
user periodically pulls changes from the shared repo, and keeps the local
mirror up-to-date.

Whenever user wants to make changes, he/she does the following.
1) Pull changes from shared repo to local mirror
2) Copy the local mirror to another directory
3) Make changes in the copy [This could take minutes, hours, days etc]
4) Pull changes from shared repo to local mirror
5) Merge changes from copy to local mirror
6) Push changes from local mirror to shared repo


WHAT IS GITHUB?
---------------
Github is a website which can be used to create and maintain git
repositories on the internet. Repositories in github can be accessed using
many protocols, including ssh, which is normally used.


HOW TO USE A GITHUB REPOSITORY
------------------------------

We will be using the shared repository model.

Github identifies computers/laptops from which the user will access it
using ssh keys. Once a ssh key is generated and added to the list of users
in github, user can do following steps to work on a shared repository.

1) Clone the repository to a local mirror

    $ git clone git@github.com:krupa32/uglab.git

2) Pull in the latest changes to the mirror (Not required first time)

    $ git pull origin master

3) Make copy of the local mirror

    $ cp -R uglab/* uglab-copy/

4) Make changes in the copy of local mirror

5) Pull in the latest changes to the mirror
	This step is required because while you were making changes, some other
user could have checked in their changes, and hence the mirror would be 
out-of-sync. The mirror HAS to be in-sync before your changes can be pushed
back to the shared repo.

    $ git pull origin master

6) Merge changes in copy to the local mirror
	Merging can be done by using vimdiff tool.

    $ vimdiff uglab-copy/test.c uglab/test.c

7) Add the changes in the mirror
	Goto the mirror directory (uglab/) and type

    $ git add .

8) Commit the changes in the mirror

    $ git commit -m "change message"

9) Push the changes to the shared repo

    $ git push
